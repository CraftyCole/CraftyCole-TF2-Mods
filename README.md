My TF2 Sticky Jump Oriented Files - Airpogo and such..

Extract outline trail into tf > custom ---
The purple isotope mod goes in - tf > custom > customstuff > particles ---
Pulsating Glowing Stickies mod goes in custom


The autoexecs go in tf > cfg. If you use them all you can control which one is active with the arrow keys, it will also change your crosshair colour. up = demo, left = soldier, down = conc, right = normal tf2

conc is mainly just for Jump Academy medic but i barely use it or normal tf2 one, feel free to edit to your liking or just take specific parts from soldier or demo autoexecs

the purple trail is outlinetrail, the other one is the tempus trail used in the tempus records and archive
